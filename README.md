Playing with the Tiled Map Editor

This project is my first time playing around with a tile editor. I have created a small, simple map
for the character to just and move around on. Play around on it and see if you can collect all the
tokens. It takes 20 points to win the game. Below is the section I have not done yet. This would be something to improve my skills later.

To earn extra credit,

 * Create main2.py
 * Copy into main2.py the code found here: [http://arcade.academy/examples/09_endgame.html#endgame](http://arcade.academy/examples/09_endgame.html#endgame).
 * in main2.py, delete the references to sounds (lines 72–75, 184, 213–214, 230, 244)
 * Create three new maps, called map2_level_1.tmx, map2_level_2.tmx, and map2_level_3.tmx
 * In each of those three maps, you will the following layers: Platforms, Coins, Foreground, Background, Don't Touch
 * Find, create, or download assets to fill out this three-level platformer. 
 * Make changes until you have a working three-level game
